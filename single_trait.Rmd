## Single trait distribution
Chinstrap penguins tend to have longer bills than Adelie and Gentoo penguins, although Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins are more similar in bill length than are Chinstrap and Adelie penguins. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  xlab("Bill Length (mm)")+
  ylab("Density")+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```
