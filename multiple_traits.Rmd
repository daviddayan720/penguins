## Relationship between multiple traits
For all three species, there is a positive relationship between body mass and flipper length. Gentoo penguins typically have the greatest body masses and flipper lengths of the three species, and for a given body mass, Chinstrap penguins tend to have longer flippers than Adelie penguins.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot()+
  xlab("Body Mass (g)")+
  ylab("Flipper Length (mm)")+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) 
  
```
