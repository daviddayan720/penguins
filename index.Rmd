## Data
These data relate to a study of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The data include information on species, island, physical data, and demographic data.

## Single trait distribution
Chinstrap penguins tend to have longer bills than Adelie and Gentoo penguins, although Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins are more similar in bill length than are Chinstrap and Adelie penguins. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  xlab("Bill Length (mm)")+
  ylab("Density")+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```

## Relationship between multiple traits
For all three species, there is a positive relationship between body mass and flipper length. Gentoo penguins typically have the greatest body masses and flipper lengths of the three species, and for a given body mass, Chinstrap penguins tend to have longer flippers than Adelie penguins.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot()+
  xlab("Body Mass (g)")+
  ylab("Flipper Length (mm)")+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) 
  
```

## Sexual dimorphism
All three species appear to have sexually dimorphic body masses, with males of all three species having greater body masses. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins_no_na <- penguins %>% filter (!is.na(sex))
penguins_no_na %>% 
  ggplot()+
  xlab("Sex")+
  ylab("Body Mass (g)")+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g, color = sex))+
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
